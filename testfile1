The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. 
For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application 
is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such 
a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.

A common pattern for liveness probes is to use the same low-cost HTTP 
endpoint as for readiness probes, but with a higher failureThreshold. 
This ensures that the pod is observed as not-ready for some period of 
time before it is hard killed.
